C - Functions
Learning to Program in C (Part 06) (stop at 14:00)
What is the purpose of a function prototype?
C - Header Files (stop before the “Once-Only Headers” paragraph)

General
What are nested loops and how to use them
What is a function and how do you use functions
What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
What is a prototype
Scope of variables
What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
What are header files and how to to use them with #include

requirements:
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h
Don’t forget to push your header file

0-isupper.c---Write a function that checks for uppercase character

1-isdigit.c--- a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

2-mul.c--- a function that multiplies two integers.

3-print_numbers.c--- a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

4-print_most_numbers.c--- a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

5-more_numbers.c--- a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

6-print_line.c--- a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

7-print_diagonal.c--- a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

8-print_square.c--- a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

9-fizz_buzz.c--- a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

10-print_triangle.c--- a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.
