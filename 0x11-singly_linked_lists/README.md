# 0x11-singly_linked_lists

## Learning Objectives:
+ When and why using linked lists vs arrays
+ How to build and use linked lists

## Requirements:
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
+ Programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
+ The code should use the Betty style.
+ Not allowed to use global variables
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit.
+ Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
+ You are allowed to use _putchar
+ The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar
+ should be included in your header file called lists.h
+ Header files should be include guarded

## Tasks:
+ Task0 - Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.
+ Task1 - Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.
+ Task2 - Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.
+ Task3 - Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.
+ Task4 - Write a function that frees a list_t list.
