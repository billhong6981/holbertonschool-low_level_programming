# 0x13-bit_manipulation

## Learning Objectives

+How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Requirements

*All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
*All programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
*All programs should be passed Betty check
*All programs not allowed to use globle variables
*The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function _putchar
should be included in your header file called holberton.h

## Tasks
